## Projects
Below is a list of projects included in this portfolio. Each project is unique and highlights a different aspect of data analytics:
### Data Cleaning with MySQL
In this project, I utilized **MySQL** to clean and preprocess a messy dataset, employing techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. This experience honed my ability to transform raw data into accurate, structured datasets, making them ready for analysis. The project showcases my expertise in **data cleaning** and **database management**.

### Netflix Content EDA Using SQL and Excel
In this project, I conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Netflix’s content library to identify insights on content distribution, release year trends, and content rating patterns. Using **MySQL Workbench**, I extracted and aggregated data from a cleaned dataset of 8,000+ movies and TV shows, and visualized the findings in **Excel**. Key results included identifying dominant content types, content rating distribution, and trends in content releases. This project highlights my proficiency in **SQL** for data manipulation and **Excel** for creating meaningful visualizations to guide strategic decisions.
