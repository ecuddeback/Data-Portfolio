# 📊 Netflix Content EDA Using SQL & Excel

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Netflix’s content library. It builds upon my previous data cleaning project, leveraging **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** to extract and aggregate data, followed by **Excel** for analysis and visualization.

### 🔍 Key Areas of Investigation:
- **Content Distribution:** Analyzed the proportion of movies vs. TV shows.
- **Release Year Trends:** Explored the years with the highest content additions.
- **Content Rating Analysis:** Evaluated the distribution of content ratings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench):** For data extraction, aggregation, and analysis.
- **Excel:** For data visualization and further trend analysis.

## 📈 Results & Insights
The EDA uncovered valuable insights into Netflix’s content landscape, highlighting genre diversity, content trends over time, and rating distribution.
