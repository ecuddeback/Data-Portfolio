📊 Netflix Content Library Analysis (EDA)
This project showcases an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix’s content library, focusing on:

Content Type Distribution: Analyzing the prevalence of movies versus TV shows.
Year of Content Addition Trends: Identifying the distribution of content added to Netflix over time.
Content Rating Analysis: Evaluating the distribution and trends of content ratings.
🔍 Overview
The dataset, which was previously cleaned in an earlier project, has been analyzed using SQL for data extraction and aggregation. The results were visualized using Excel to create charts and graphs that highlight key patterns and trends.
